"""
This module provides a solution to the N Queens puzzle using backtracking. The puzzle consists of placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. The program will print every possible solution, one per line.

The module includes the following functions:
- print_board: Prints the current board state with queens placed.
- is_safe: Checks if it is safe to place a queen at a given position.
- solve_nqueens: Recursively solves the N Queens problem using backtracking.
- nqueens: Initiates the solving process and handles input validation.
